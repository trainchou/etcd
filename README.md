### Release Candidate Disclaimer ###

The current `master` branch of etcd is tracking the forthcoming 2.0.0 release.
We encourage users to work with the [latest release candidate](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.1), but those looking for a stable release should obtain the latest 0.4.x release, [0.4.6](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/tag/v0.4.6).

Unless otherwise noted, the etcd documentation below and in [`Documentation/`](Documentation) refers to configuring and running 0.4.x releases.
Documentation related to the 2.0.0 release candidates can be found in the [`Documentation/2.0`](Documentation/) directory.

## README version 0.4.6

A highly-available key value store for shared configuration and service discovery.
etcd is inspired by [Apache ZooKeeper][zookeeper] and [doozer][doozer], with a focus on being:

* *Simple*: curl'able user facing API (HTTP+JSON)
* *Secure*: optional SSL client cert authentication
* *Fast*: benchmarked 1000s of writes/s per instance
* *Reliable*: properly distributed using Raft

etcd is written in Go and uses the [Raft][raft] consensus algorithm to manage a highly-available replicated log.

See [etcdctl][etcdctl] for a simple command line client.
Or feel free to just use curl, as in the examples below.

[doozer]: https://github.com/ha/doozerd
[raft]: http://raftconsensus.github.io/

If you're considering etcd for production use, please see: [production-ready.md](./Documentation/production-ready.md)

## Getting Started

### Getting etcd

The latest release and setup instructions are available at [GitHub][github-release].

[github-release]: https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/

### Running etcd

First start a single-machine cluster of etcd:

```sh
./bin/etcd
```

This will bring up etcd listening on port 4001 for client communication and on port 7001 for server-to-server communication.

Next, let's set a single key, and then retrieve it:

```
curl -L http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/mykey -XPUT -d value="this is awesome"
curl -L http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/mykey
```

You have successfully started an etcd on a single machine and written a key to the store. Now it's time to dig into the full etcd API and other guides.

### Next Steps

- Explore the full [API][api].
- Set up a [multi-machine cluster][clustering].
- Learn the [config format, env variables and flags][configuration].
- Find [language bindings and tools][libraries-and-tools].
- Learn about the dashboard, lock and leader election [modules][modules].
- Use TLS to [secure an etcd cluster][security].
- [Tune etcd][tuning].
- [Upgrade from old version][upgrade].

## Project Details

### Versioning

#### Service Versioning

etcd uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org)
New minor versions may add additional features to the API.

You can get the version of etcd by issuing a request to /version:

```sh
curl -L http://127.0.0.1:4001/version
```

#### API Versioning

The `v2` API responses should not change after the 0.2.0 release but new features will be added over time.

The `v1` API has been deprecated and will not be supported. It will be removed in the 2.0.0 release.

#### 32-bit systems

etcd has known issues on 32-bit systems due to a bug in the Go runtime. See #[358][358] for more information.
